# EmergencyCall

EmergencyCall is an iOS app containing a simple widget for iOS notification center. Its usage is very simple: 

  - The user doesn't need to register to use the service; once the app is installed it's ready to be used;
  - In the settings the user can choose which number to see in the widget (based on current location the number shown change); 
  - A widget containing selected emergency numbers is added to the iOS notification center; this widget automatically updates if the current location has different emergency numbers.
  

  
The concept of the app is simple, but was created before the main emergency services released their official apps for fast and precise emergency response! 

EmergencyCall has been on the App Store from 2017 to 2020 and was downloaded a total of 800 times from countries around Europe.
